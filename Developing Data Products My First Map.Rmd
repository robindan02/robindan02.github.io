## Introduction
  
Leaflet is one of the most popular Javascript libraries for
creating interactive maps. The leaflet R package allows you
to create your own leaflet maps without needing to know any
Javascript!

## My First Map

Getting started with leaflet is easy. The `leaflet()`
function creates a map widget that you can store in a
variable so that you can modify the map later on. You can
add features to the map using the pipe operator (`%>%`) just
like in dplyr. The `addTiles()` function adds mapping data
from [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## Your First Map

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()
my_map <- my_map %>%
            addMarkers(lat=38.624691, lng=-90.184776, popup="St Louis Arch")
            my_map

```
